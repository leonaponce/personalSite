A chat application. 

Think of something like stripped-down Slack.
People enter without authentication and are assigned a name, stored for when they come back. The chat history is stored and retrieved from a database. You can add notifications (pop up or sound) in the browser for when someone sends a new message.

We’ll build a chatbot framework using Tensorflow and add some context handling to show how this can be approached.
