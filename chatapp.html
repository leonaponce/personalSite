When I started writing this article, I knew nothing about bots. I had a superficially working knowledge of AI and how supervised learning worked in general but to me NLP was just an acronym that meant Natural Language Processing. About half of the reasons why I started investigating chatbots was to learn more about the gaps I had in my knowledge of this particular play. Someone put it well —

How did making a bot make more business sense?

he bot industry is in its infancy right now and they are all competing for the same thing — to find the next killer app that makes chatbots mainstream. There are no reigning champions in the chatbot domain as of now. The whole industry is a level playing field.

I talked with a lot of people to investigate how far we really are into this future. It was an educational ride just I had imagined. Common consensus with the experts that I talked to put the timeframe to about two years to five years until we see a really killer app for the chatbot platform. The technology still in its evolution, it is safe to say that the even the best chatbots of today can grow obsolete because of newer announcements in AI and NLP research.

It means that if the right idea struck, anyone could make the potential killer app. This revelation was highly motivating. Right now, the chatbots I played with seemed to be doing quite simple things but in all essence they were just replacement for the GUI. Two things that I noticed in particular with the good ones were:

If performing a task took longer than 2 steps on UI, chatbots provided a much better user experience.
Places in the UI where the task was just a simple search and tap, chatbots seemed redundant.

In summary:
Whether you write a UI or a chatbot, it doesn’t really matter. The user will come to your solution only if it saves time.

The decision to build a chatbot instead of an app does indeed carry business merit. It saves time in longer than expected UI flows. The next part of my journey was actually making a bot to see how deep the waters really go.

Building a chatbot was like solving a reasonably-sized jigsaw puzzle for me. I just had to find the right pieces and the tools needed to build it. While I had some of the puzzle at an arm's length, I was still confused on where to start. I had a checklist of two items —

1. Bot should talk like a person: meaning that it should understand natural language.
2. Bot should be able to solve a non-trivial use case: meaning that it should do something that takes more than two steps to do in UI (business merit).

  It has a learning curve. Agreed. But what doesn’t?

  It was a very liberating exercise to learn something methodically and then go on ahead and make a working proof of concept. I was feeling good.
