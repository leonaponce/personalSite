<h1>Chatbot Project - A Lesson in AI and Natural Laguage Processing</h1> 

Neural Net

Purpose
Create a well planned chatbot application with context. We will 
design a framework for planning the bot as well as a conversational model 
for an island moped shop. The chatbot will handle simple questions regarding 
hours of operation, reservation options, etc. We also wish to address 
any inquiries into same day rentals.

STEPS TO COMPLETE CHATBOT
We will perform the following:

1. Transform conversational intent definitions to a Tensorflow model
2. Build a chatbot framework to process responses
3. Show how basic context can be incorporated into our response processor

TECHNOLOGIES UTILIZED

TFLearn
http://tflearn.org/

Tensorflow
https://www.tensorflow.org/

Python
https://www.python.org/

iPython Notebook
https://ipython.org/notebook.html

STEP 1: Transform conversational intent definitions to a Tensorflow model

A chatbot framework needs a structure in which conversational
intents are defined. A JSON file is a great tool for this challenge

E.G. JSON file https://github.com/ugik/notebooks/blob/master/intents.json

Three elements will be defined in each conversational intent:
1. a tag, which will have a unique name
2. patterns, which are sentence patterns for our neural network text classifier
3. response, which are comprised of example responses


Notebook for Step 1: https://github.com/ugik/notebooks/blob/master/Tensorflow%20chat-bot%20model.ipynb

  A. Import necessary tools and software
    # things we need for NLP
    import nltk
    from nltk.stem.lancaster import LancasterStemmer
    stemmer = LancasterStemmer()
    
    # things we need for Tensorflow
    import numpy as np
    import tflearn
    import tensorflow as tf
    import random

  B. After the intents JSON file is loaded, we can start building organized
  documents, words and classification classes.

    The lists of documents we crate are simmply sentences
    with each sentence being a list of stemmed words and each 
    document associated with an intent (=class)

    Tensorflow cannot process from documents of words,
    so we will tranform our data furthe into tensors of numbers.
    
    -----
    Our data is now shuffled. Tensorflow will use some of this
    mixed data to test our data to guage accuract for a newly fitted
    model.







Think of something like stripped-down Slack.
People enter without authentication and are assigned a name, stored for when they come back. The chat history is stored and retrieved from a database. You can add notifications (pop up or sound) in the browser for when someone sends a new message.

We’ll build a chatbot framework using Tensorflow and add some context handling to show how this can be approached.

Class = 

JSON File =  JSON is short for JavaScript Object Notation, and is a way to store information in an organized, easy-to-access manner. 
In a nutshell, it gives us a human-readable collection of data that we can access in a really logical manner.
To access the information stored in a variable we stored in a JSON file, we can simply refer to the name of the property we need. 


Many sites are sharing data using JSON in addition to RSS feeds nowadays, and with good reason: JSON feeds can be loaded asynchronously much more easily than XML/RSS.

Tools
We’ll be using tflearn, a layer above tensorflow, and of course Python. As always we’ll use iPython notebook as a tool to facilitate our work.

  It has a learning curve. Agreed. But what doesn’t?

  It was a very liberating exercise to learn something methodically and then go on ahead and make a working proof of concept. I was feeling good.



<p>I started writing this article, I knew nothing about bots. I had a superficially working knowledge of AI and how supervised learning worked in general but to me NLP was just an acronym that meant Natural Language Processing. About half of the reasons why I started investigating chatbots was to learn more about the gaps I had in my knowledge of this particular play. Someone put it well —

How did making a bot make more business sense?

he bot industry is in its infancy right now and they are all competing for the same thing — to find the next killer app that makes chatbots mainstream. There are no reigning champions in the chatbot domain as of now. The whole industry is a level playing field.

I talked with a lot of people to investigate how far we really are into this future. It was an educational ride just I had imagined. Common consensus with the experts that I talked to put the timeframe to about two years to five years until we see a really killer app for the chatbot platform. The technology still in its evolution, it is safe to say that the even the best chatbots of today can grow obsolete because of newer announcements in AI and NLP research.

It means that if the right idea struck, anyone could make the potential killer app. This revelation was highly motivating. Right now, the chatbots I played with seemed to be doing quite simple things but in all essence they were just replacement for the GUI. Two things that I noticed in particular with the good ones were:

If performing a task took longer than 2 steps on UI, chatbots provided a much better user experience.
Places in the UI where the task was just a simple search and tap, chatbots seemed redundant.</p>

In summary:
Whether you write a UI or a chatbot, it doesn’t really matter. The user will come to your solution only if it saves time.

The decision to build a chatbot instead of an app does indeed carry business merit. It saves time in longer than expected UI flows. The next part of my journey was actually making a bot to see how deep the waters really go.

Building a chatbot was like solving a reasonably-sized jigsaw puzzle for me. I just had to find the right pieces and the tools needed to build it. While I had some of the puzzle at an arm's length, I was still confused on where to start. I had a checklist of two items —

1. Bot should talk like a person: meaning that it should understand natural language.
2. Bot should be able to solve a non-trivial use case: meaning that it should do something that takes more than two steps to do in UI (business merit).


aking a chatbot for my own personal use opened me to a world of possibilities. People are solving so many of their problems with clustered UI like booking travel tickets, hotels, movie tickets, ordering food, etc. The user experience can be improved by leaps and bounds by introducing a bot UI there. The newness of the platform really excites me, to be honest. It’s the age when new Facebooks and Whatsapps emerge out of darkness.

I believe in a world not far away in time, everything would be done via a conversational bot like in the movie, Her. It would be more efficient than even a single tap on your smartphone screen. I wouldn’t advise falling in love with your Samantha, though. ;)

Jokes apart, the chatbot play is definitely an emerging trend. Everyone is debating whether it would last or not. But trends don’t live or die by their own. It’s people that make or unmake them.

I believe hype is an instrument that brings obscurity into mainstream. The industry is just learning what all it can do with this relatively new tech. It’s a bet worth taking as a businessman and a skill worth learning as an engineer.

After all, the best bots are yet to be made.-->
