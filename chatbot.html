A chatbot application. 

Neural Net

Purpose
Create a well planned chatbot application with context. We will 
design a framework for planning the bot as well as a conversational model 
for an island moped shop. The chatbot will handle simple questions regarding 
hours of operation, reservation options, etc. We also wish to address 
any inquiries into same day rentals.

STEPS TO COMPLETE CHATBOT
We will perform the following:

1. Transform conversational intent definitions to a Tensorflow model
2. Build a chatbot framework to process responses
3. Show how basic context can be incorporated into our response processor

TECHNOLOGIES UTILIZED

TFLearn
http://tflearn.org/

Tensorflow
https://www.tensorflow.org/

Python
https://www.python.org/

iPython Notebook
https://ipython.org/notebook.html

STEP 1: Transform conversational intent definitions to a Tensorflow model

A chatbot framework needs a structure in which conversational
intents are defined. A JSON file is a great tool for this challenge

E.G. JSON file https://github.com/ugik/notebooks/blob/master/intents.json

Three elements will be defined in each conversational intent:
1. a tag, which will have a unique name
2. patterns, which are sentence patterns for our neural network text classifier
3. response, which are comprised of example responses


Notebook for Step 1: https://github.com/ugik/notebooks/blob/master/Tensorflow%20chat-bot%20model.ipynb

  A. Import necessary tools and software
    # things we need for NLP
    import nltk
    from nltk.stem.lancaster import LancasterStemmer
    stemmer = LancasterStemmer()
    
    # things we need for Tensorflow
    import numpy as np
    import tflearn
    import tensorflow as tf
    import random

  B. After the intents JSON file is loaded, we can start building organized
  documents, words and classification classes.

    The lists of documents we crate are simmply sentences
    with each sentence being a list of stemmed words and each 
    document associated with an intent (=class)

    Tensorflow cannot process from documents of words,
    so we will tranform our data furthe into tensors of numbers.
    
    -----
    Our data is now shuffled. Tensorflow will use some of this
    mixed data to test our data to guage accuract for a newly fitted
    model.







Think of something like stripped-down Slack.
People enter without authentication and are assigned a name, stored for when they come back. The chat history is stored and retrieved from a database. You can add notifications (pop up or sound) in the browser for when someone sends a new message.

We’ll build a chatbot framework using Tensorflow and add some context handling to show how this can be approached.

JSON File =  JSON is short for JavaScript Object Notation, and is a way to store information in an organized, easy-to-access manner. 
In a nutshell, it gives us a human-readable collection of data that we can access in a really logical manner.
To access the information stored in a variable we stored in a JSON file, we can simply refer to the name of the property we need. 


Many sites are sharing data using JSON in addition to RSS feeds nowadays, and with good reason: JSON feeds can be loaded asynchronously much more easily than XML/RSS.

Tools
We’ll be using tflearn, a layer above tensorflow, and of course Python. As always we’ll use iPython notebook as a tool to facilitate our work.

  It has a learning curve. Agreed. But what doesn’t?

  It was a very liberating exercise to learn something methodically and then go on ahead and make a working proof of concept. I was feeling good.-->
