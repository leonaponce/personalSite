A chatbot application. 

Neural Net

Purpose
Create a well planned chatbot application with context. We will 
design a framework for planning the bot as well as a conversational model 
for an island moped shop. The chatbot will handle simple questions regarding 
hours of operation, reservation options, etc. We also wish to address 
any inquiries into same day rentals.

STEPS TO COMPLETE CHATBOT
We will perform the following:

1. Transform conversational intent definitions to a Tensorflow model
2. Build a chatbot framework to process responses
3. Show how basic context can be incorporated into our response processor

STEP 1: Transform conversational intent definitions to a Tensorflow model

A chatbot framework needs a structure in which conversational
intents are defined. A JSON file is a great tool for this challenge

E.G. JSON file https://github.com/ugik/notebooks/blob/master/intents.json

Three elements will be defined in each conversational intent:
1. a tag, which will have a unique name
2. patterns, which are sentence patterns for our neural network text classifier
3. response, which are comprised of example responses

  A. Import necessary tools and software
    # things we need for NLP
    import nltk
    from nltk.stem.lancaster import LancasterStemmer
    stemmer = LancasterStemmer()
    
    # things we need for Tensorflow
    import numpy as np
    import tflearn
    import tensorflow as tf
    import random

    



Think of something like stripped-down Slack.
People enter without authentication and are assigned a name, stored for when they come back. The chat history is stored and retrieved from a database. You can add notifications (pop up or sound) in the browser for when someone sends a new message.

Weâ€™ll build a chatbot framework using Tensorflow and add some context handling to show how this can be approached.

JSON File =  JSON is short for JavaScript Object Notation, and is a way to store information in an organized, easy-to-access manner. 
In a nutshell, it gives us a human-readable collection of data that we can access in a really logical manner.
To access the information stored in a variable we stored in a JSON file, we can simply refer to the name of the property we need. 


Many sites are sharing data using JSON in addition to RSS feeds nowadays, and with good reason: JSON feeds can be loaded asynchronously much more easily than XML/RSS.
